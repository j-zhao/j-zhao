### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! Iâ€™m just an ordinary guy with lots of interests and dreams.

Currently, Iâ€™m currently a Sr. Software / Data Engineer at Epic Games, working on all things Streaming within Epicâ€™s Data Platform. Previously, Iâ€™ve spent time working on Uberâ€™s Airport business, as well as Digital Payments at Amazon.

Iâ€™m also an avid classical pianist, and love listening to various genres of music. In my free time, I love watching and playing basketball, throwing yo-yos, solving Rubikâ€™s Cubes puzzles quickly, as well as diving into films and books.
